#SELECTION OF WHITE MOLD ISOLATES (_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_) FOR FUNGICIDE _IN VITRO_ TEST BY DISCRIMINATORY DOSES  


Before produce Knit run line 263 twice  
##Background  
There are by very huge amount of isolates in which sampling is needed in order to know if fungicide sensitivity has decreased through the space and time.  

##Objective
 1. Select hierarchieally isolates by space
 2. From objective 1, make a Venn diagram as a filterring those already used andselect hierarchieally isolates by time

###Data wrangling

wm1_ <-  wm1 %>%
  group_by(Field) %>% 
   mutate(Fungicide_status = ifelse(Collection_ID  %in% tested, "tested", "no_tested")) %>%  # Creating a new column based wheather or not funcides pretested
  filter(!Collection_ID %in% mexican_isolates) %>%#Taking out mexican isolates
  mutate (num_isolates_per_field = ifelse(n() > 2, "2>isolates/Field", "<3isolates/Field")) %>%#Creating a new column if the number of isolates/field is major than 2
  ungroup()

wm1_$num_isolates_per_field <- as.factor(wm1_$num_isolates_per_field)#Converting as factor the levels of the new columns

```
###Cleaning and making some arrangemments from the inventory so far, run twice
```{r, warning= FALSE}
wm1_ <- wm1_[-970, ]# Taking out this column that is in blank
wm1_$long <- as.numeric(as.character(wm1_$long))# Transforming long variables to numeric
wm1_$long <- (wm1_$long) * -1 # Transforming the long variable to the Hemispher West side

```
###Subsetting some data
```{r}
# Creating the base map for subsequent plots
mid_west_base <-

         mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +

  filter(num_ISO_per_field > 10) %>% 
         #DNA.Extraction == "No DNA extraction") #%>%# Filtering those fields with more than 10 isolates/ field . Here the original idea was to filter by 3 >= isolates but  it does not not work with the next pipe available from tidyverse 
  sample_n(3, replace = F) #Randomly sampled 3 isolates from the 10 available from each group 

# Subdata another one to work with those groups with less than 10 isolates and more or equal to 3 isolates. The way to do it was to rest to the ones done 
selection2 <- selection %>%# using the master dataframe
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(State, County, Field) %>%#grouping in order to select 3 isolates/field/County/State 
  filter(!num_ISO_per_field %in% selection1$num_ISO_per_field) %>%
 # filter(DNA.Extraction == "No DNA extraction") %>%#filterring those already done 
  ungroup()

```
###Finding randomly either by function or by hand writing  3 samples for each (by sample function) field for those groupings with less than 10 isolates/field. In those cases of error it is due there is less than 3 isolates per field but it still being okay

    Year,
    Origin,
    long,

    hyphal_tip..ht.,

    num_isolates_per_field
  ) %>%# Selecting 15 the most important columns so far
  group_by(State, County, Field) %>%
  mutate(num_ISO_per_field = n()) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  group_by(County) %>%
  mutate(num_field_County = length(unique(factor(Field)))) %>%
  select(
    Collection_ID,
    State,
    County,
    Field,
    num_ISO_per_field,

    num_isolates_per_field
  )
#Subdata for randomly selection of those 3 isolates/field/county/state
selection_Mexico1 <- selection_Mexico %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(State, County, Field) %>%#grouping in order to select 3 isolates/field/County/State
  filter(num_ISO_per_field > 10) %>% 
        # DNA.Extraction == "No DNA extraction") %>%# Filtering those fields with more than 10 isolates/ field and also by no DNA extraction. Here the original idea was to filter by 3 >= isolates but  it does not not work with the next pipe available from tidyverse
  sample_n(3, replace = F)#Randomly sampled 3 isolates from the 10 available from each group

# Subdata another one to work with those groups with less than 10 isolates and more or equal to 3 isolates. The way to do it was to rest to the ones done
selection_Mexico2 <- selection_Mexico %>% # using the dataframe Selection_Mexico 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(State, County, Field) %>%#grouping in order to select 3 isolates/field/County/State
  filter(!num_ISO_per_field %in% selection_Mexico1$num_ISO_per_field) %>%
  #filter(DNA.Extraction == "No DNA extraction") %>% #filtering those already done and also by no DNA extraction
  ungroup()
```
###Finding randomly either by function or by hand writing  3 samples for each (by sample function) field for those groupings with less than 10 isolates/field. In those cases of error it is due there is less than 3 isolates per field but it still being okay
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ccc <-
  sample(selection_Mexico2$Collection_ID,# sampling 3 for each group
         size = 3,
         replace = FALSE)


```
###Once all filters, add a new column called "selected" to the master mix dataframe     

#Selection of the country of Mexico  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
selection_Mexico <- selection_Mexico %>%
  mutate(
    Selected = case_when(
      Collection_ID %in% selection_Mexico1$Collection_ID ~ "selected",# filtering and naming "selected"" in case of in
      Collection_ID %in% ccc ~ "selected",
      TRUE ~ "not_selected"# in case of not, naming "not_selected""
    )
  )
```
##Dataframe of selection of objective 1
```{r}
##Summarizing selected by Widwest
selection3 <-
  selection %>% filter(Selected == "selected") %>% ungroup()
##Summarizing selected by Mexico
selection_Mexico3 <-
  selection_Mexico %>% filter(Selected == "selected") %>% ungroup()
# Combining both
selection_FINAL_objective1_genotyping <-
  selection3 %>% bind_rows(selection_Mexico3)%>% 
   filter(DNA.Extraction == "No DNA extraction") #by no DNA extraction
```
#selection for genotyping
